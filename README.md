# Intermediate-Firebase-Security-Rules

- from a video of the same name "Intermediate topics in Firebase Security Rules"

## How Initialized

Really this project was initialized with code from another repo. Kinda dumb, because it could be in the same repo but this keeps it true with the two videos, one for each repo.

Started with [this repo](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/Unit-testing-security-rules-Firebase-Emulator-Suite)
